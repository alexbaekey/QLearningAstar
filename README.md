Implementation of Q-Learning and A\* algorithms to move an agent across a grid full of obstacles. 

User is allowed to edit values for both programs within values.conf

To run the program with the values configuration (recommended), the '-c' flag is required:
``` 
python Qlearn_walking_agent.py -c
```

User may also input values individually by using the -i flag
```
python Qlearn_walking_agent.py -i
```

Evaluation plots and resulting arrays are added to "results" directory
